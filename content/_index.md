header: Investigating Viral Evolution and Host Interactions through Data
---

I am interested in how viruses evolve and interact with their hosts to persist. I focus on building computational methods that extract meaningful patterns from large-scale sequencing and multi-omics data to better understand viral biology.

During my PhD, I worked on SARS-CoV-2 intra-host evolution, building scalable tools to refine low-frequency mutations and track signals of selection across global sequencing data. This work combined genomics, population genetics, and dimensionality reduction to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 changes within individuals and across populations.

Now, as a postdoc, I am extending this line of inquiry to study integrated viral reservoirs using single-cell data from SIV-infected non-human primates. I aim to identify viral integration sites, assess their impact on host gene regulation, and test whether certain integration events drive clonal expansion.

I’m also drawn to systems virology—integrating epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to profile infected cells over time. I apply bioinformatics tools that scale to large datasets, with a focus on interpretability, multi-omics integration, and dimensionality reduction.

Across these projects, I’m interested in how viruses shape and are shaped by host systems, where I use data to trace that interplay.
