header: A Big Data Approach to Viral Diversity and Evolution
---

My research is centered on the evolution of RNA viruses, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2. I developed a suite of innovative computational tools and workflows for high-throughput sequencing data and applied it to an analysis of the virus' evolutionary dynamics. My findings, which are published in several peer-reviewed journals, provide insights into how RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 adapt to new hosts and environments.

Skilled in genomic surveillance, data representation, and the integration of advanced bioinformatics techniques, I strive to enhance our understanding of diversity and evolution, particularly with respect to other pathogenic viruses, evolutionary developmental biology, and cancer clonal mutations.
