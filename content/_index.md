header: A Big Data Approach to Viral Diversity and Evolution
---

I specialize in bioinformatics, focusing on viral genomics and evolutionary dynamics, particularly for SARS-CoV-2. My work involves developing innovative computational tools and workflows to process large-scale sequencing data, which I apply to uncover the evolutionary patterns of RNA viruses. My research aims to understand better how viruses like SARS-CoV-2 adapt to new environments and hosts, providing insights into their evolution.

I have experience in genomic surveillance, data representation, and applying advanced bioinformatics techniques. My research is focused on improving our understanding of viral diversity, particularly in the context of pathogenic viruses.
